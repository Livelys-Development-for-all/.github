# .github
Welcome to Livelysdevops. I'm a student trying to learn as much about programming as possible.
I've been learning Kotlin, Python, JavaScript, C++, C#, HTML, CSS, to be honest I've been learning the fundamentals of computers and software. I'm very late to the game because i haven't used a computer before two years ago. before then my only experience was with android. 
I'm looking forward to helping out with others programs where I am able and growing as a software engineer with the help of the tools available on GitHub and by learning from all the amazing programming who use this platform. I'd also love to join anyone who up to code with others and I'd like any feedback, advice, or any kind of feedback that you have.
